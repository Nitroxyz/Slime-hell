PLEASE MAKE THE BURST FASTER
I'm gonna try and do it myself but if it is still the same speed you will need to do it.



I turned off the music while I was testing
 go to system_system
 go to room start event
 uncomment the line of code.
 I believe in you :)
 
 please don't change the speed of bob. if you wanted to do that you should have done it last night. 
 it is too late to rebalance all of the attacks now.
 
 
 add walls on the edges of the screen
 
 UI layer was missing
	when we did the merge we accidentally removed both the UI and Layer9 layers.
	I Re-added them both UI layer but you should make sure the UI layer is at a depth that you like
	I also Re-added the burst meter but you should make sure you like the location.
	

	
there needs to be somewhere in the game where the freeze (name for burst) mechanic is explained
	specifically, the part about the meter being drained while you are in the blue circle it leaves on the ground.
	ik we have the UI and stuff but the player prob wont be watching it that closely and without a sound effect its not clear enough. it needs to be explained in text.
	we could put some text on the controls screen or have it as a tip on the death screen.
	something like "Use freeze to destroy all the projectiles around you! While standing on frozen ground, your freeze will slowly drain freeze charge."
	
	
Make the game fullscreen
	
you can make the explosion use the one beef made but honestly I dont really care at this point.
